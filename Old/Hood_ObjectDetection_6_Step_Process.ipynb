    "The technique uses image pyramids and sliding windows to minimize the effect of object location and object size. The pyramid is a set of subsample images and the sliding window remains the same and moves from left to right and top to bottom of each scale of the image.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sliding_window_example.gif\" loop=3>\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is common to use a stepSize of 4 to 8 pixels\n",
    "* windowSize is the size of the Kernal. An object detector will work best if the aspect ratio of the kernal is close to that of the desired object. Note: The sliding window size is also important for the HOG filter. For the HOG filter two parameters are important: <b>pixels_per_cell</b> and <b>cells_per_block </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid having to 'guess' at the best window size that will satisfy object detector requirements and HOG requirments, a \"explore_dims.py\" method is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Meet object detection requirments: loads all the images and computes the average width, average height, and computes the aspect ratio from those values.\n",
    "2.) Meet HOG requirments: Pyimage rule of thumb is to divide the above values by two (ie, 1/4th the average size)\n",
    "    * This reduces the size of the HOG feature vector\n",
    "    * By dividing by two, a nice balance is struck between HOG feature vector size and reasonable window size.\n",
    "    * Note: Our sliding_window dimension needs to be divisible by pixels_per_cell and cells_per_block so that the HOG descriptor will 'fit' into the window size\n",
    "    * Its common for 'pixels_per_cell' to be a multiple of 4 and cells_per_block in the set (1,2,3)\n",
    "    * Start with pixels_per_cell=(4,4) and cells_per_block=(2,2)\n",
    "    * For example, in the Pyimage example, average W: 184 and average H:62. Divide by 2 ==> 92,31\n",
    "    * Find values close to 92,31 that are divisible by 4 (and 2): 96,32  (Easy)\n",
    "    * OBSERVATION:  When defining the binding boxes, it is best if all are around the same size. This can be difficult.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The 6 Step Framework\n",
    "1. Sample P positive samples for your training data of the objects you want to detect. Extract HOG features from these objects.\n",
    "    * If given an a general image containing the object, bounding boxes will also need to be given that indicate the location of the image\n",
    "2. Sample N negative samples that do not contain the object and extract HOG features. In general N>>P  (I'd suggest images similar in size and aspect ratio to the P samples. I'd also avoid the bounding boxes and make the entire image the negative image. Pyimagesearch recommends using the 13 Natural Scene Category of the vision.stanford.edu/resources_links.html page\n",
    "3. Train a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the negative images (class 0) and positive image (class 1)\n",
    "4. Hard Negative Mining - for the N negative images, apply Sliding window and test the classifier. Ideally, they should all return 0. If they return a 1 indicating an incorrect classification, add it to the training set (for the next round of re-training)\n",
    "5. Re-train classifier using with the added images from Hard Negative Mining (Usually once is enough)\n",
    "6. Apply against test dataset, define a box around regions of high probability, when finished with the image, find the boxed region with the highest probability using \"non-maximum suppression\" to removed redundant and overlapping bounding boxes and make that the final box.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note on DLIB library\n",
    "* Similar to the 6 step framework but uses the entire training image to get the P's (indicated by bounding boxes) and the N's (not containing bounding boxes).  Note: It looks like it is important that all of the objects are identified in the image. For example, when doing running bibs, I may ignore some bibs for some reasons (too small, partially blocked, too many). My guess is that these images should just simply be avoided. This technique eliminates steps 2, 4, and 5.\n",
    "* non-maximum supression is applied during the trainig phase helping to reduce false positives\n",
    "* dlib using a highly accurate SVM engine used to find the hyperplane separating the TWO classes.\n",
